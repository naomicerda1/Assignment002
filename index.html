        <p>"What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?‚Äù</p>
        <p>What I hope to learn in this CSS course is to think outside the box and learn different ways of formatting.</p>
        <p>The second thing I hope to learn is how to use the psuedo-class or the selectors. The idea is there but to actually code it and see the different fun ways to use it would be interesting.</p>
        <p>Finally, I usually have a hard time getting my pages to link and function. I know VSC helps point out the problems along the bars, so I guess I mean understanding VSC more.</p>
